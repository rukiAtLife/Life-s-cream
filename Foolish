How foolish is this. I sat down, then I thought well people going to good schools must be really helped
by them right. . . . Wait, Wait. No Shit No.

There is no way a university will help you do anything such as finding a job or such. It won't help
you start a buisness. Get funding or anything of that sort.

IT is you. But entering the univeristy now you know these 

Colleges are great.
