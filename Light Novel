Those who say reading Manga is a time waster and not worth anyone's time. I want you to consider 
actually reading them. Cause there is a lot of stuff out there that will literally change your life.
K. I got to admit not many people take them seriously but when you treat them like myths (some) 
they turn into really nice life lessons about others and yourself.

I though didn't know how to speak english got to learn how to talk, how to capticate, and how to 
inspire others from Light novels. You may not believe this but many times me reading them allows
me to trasmit my ideas in a more clear and consise format. 

Yes, things that are not even in English to begin with. Taught me about how to speak.
