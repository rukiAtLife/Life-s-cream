Hello this is life. 


Life I imagine is like:
A sole island on a planet with water all around. Time a rock on the planet. This rock has scratches all on the rock, they scratches run deep. There is a metal plate on the rock. Then there is sand around the rock. There are other planets all with the same structure.

Many things can be infereed from this model or interpretation of life. Things from marriage, intelect, expereience, talent, and many more.

You are but an entity the whole land, they things you can control are but a entity/the world unable to leave only can change the world or observe other worlds. 

The way or parts you can change are your experiences. . . . . 

The metal in the rock is the glint of your world sometimes of the space in the sky you occupy. You can move to diffrent areas but doing something diffrent won't be your talent. 

I want to . . . .
