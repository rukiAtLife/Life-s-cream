I am pretty wierd. Honestly I don't think I know why both e=why I think that and why I am how I am.

But I can tell that I am wierd cause I don't act like people around me, societal rules have to be 
forced upon me to obey them and I feel uncomfortable doing it still.

Like throughout high school everyone had the expecation of students to have a long commitment to 
something. Academic and more. I didn't really just when my grades dropped if I cared enough I would
try to pick them back up. But won't really stress about doing that if I don't want to.

I am suprised that I actually maintained or have the grades I currently do. It's definetely has 
exceeded what I would think about. Another thing is the college apps coming up, most people have
started doing it like since april. Which I should have but I am liking doubting what is a college.

That doesn't make sense does it. No seriously I have digged up what colleges such as MIT, Stanford,
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the like (UC's!) opperate. 

Random { A quote I like is: "The world used to be a bigger world. No, the world is still the same it's
just that there is less in it." }

Well, why? I don't know I felt like I should there is so much to that I don't know about. Then I found
why I shoulc
