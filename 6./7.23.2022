Do you know what it is like to die emotionally?

"Everyone has 5-ish basic emotions. Sadness, Anger, Fear, Happiness, & Calm. They are like code blocks.
That can vary in intensity and in order making up everything else."

Anyways there are 5 things people find important in life.
- Relationships
- Money
- Health
- Emotions 
- Intellect

There are 5 things that destroy them.
- Death.
- Disaster
- Disease
- Intensity (Intensity of Relationships, Money, Health, Emotions, and Intellect destory them.)
- Time

Any five of these can destroy or fix the other death can kill relatiohsips. Relationships can mend
the damage brought upon by death. Disease degrade health but the can also help us become more 
resilient. Time can increase and decrease Intellect. &  more..

But in the end everything returns to nothing, at the end of life there is no death, disaster, disease,
intensity, or time. Like there are no relationships, money, health, emotions, or intellect. 
People don't fear death, people fear what comes after. Cause the unknown or lack of control is what
terifies us humans. Its why people; revolt; fear AI & progress; create history; and Myths. 

"But deem down there is an emotion lying dormant, Indifference." Which is not just calm which brings 
with it a soothing nature. Indiffrence is diffrent. 

Their is nothing not black or white or anything in between. 

I have went from 
Anger --> Sadness
Sadness --> Cal,
Sadness --> Happiness
