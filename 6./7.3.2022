So this month. I am confused. I did some digging and My family does love me unconditionally. However
the confusing thing is I don't seem to understand this type of love. It's like deep down they want 
one thing my happiness. But the way they do so is wierd to say the least. 

Anyways I was two days late for this cause guests  came over. Really fun. This repository is really 
eye oppening. Especially going back to the things I thought before, really just helps me analyze myself.

I am trying to start a buisness (*2) they both have ideas that are really just feasible. I haven't 
found the exact product-market fit but I believe that's fine. 

There is also people that I know about that I am inspired from (Lucy Guo). She really has that Steve
Jobs vibe but better or at least changed. I really want her to succeded. 

Sorry I had to attend to a multiple things the past few days so I continue today.
