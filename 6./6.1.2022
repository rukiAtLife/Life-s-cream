Wow! What a time to start writing. I didn't know it was the start of the 6th month. Huh. K.

So . . As I listen to music, let me tell you about myself.

- A Rising Senior at High School
- Dream: To make another world. Yep, that's it. I seriously don't care about money
Like Warren Buffet said, "I don't care how much money you have in the bank account, if people who
you want to recieve love from don't love you OR you aren't tought of well by them. Then your life
is miserable." 

Well my life is still misreable. Not cause I am chasing money, but cause I don't think I have anyone
I could say would love me. Sure my parent's want to do anything they can to help me in any way, and
I have many friends who help me out get stuff together, but no true friend. 

Right now, I am seriously scared about the world, I see so many disasters. People killing each other, 
mass shootings in schools, and hospitals like today. Well where was I parents, yeah, some might find
it like I lie? I don't know what i mean when I say love is Unconditional Love. I go to my mom and hug 
her but I don't feel her warmth, I know she is defintely tired nowdays, but even before. (Here I cry)
I don't know if it too much to ask.

Anyways, my best friends always end up stabbing me in the back. Like, I help them out and its great 
like. They love it they come to me and ask me questions on stuff and for my feedback. I give them 
"uncoditional" treatment. Seriously, I give them my plans and ideas. I get + got into trouble for it
I don't achieve stuff, but its fine I made a goo friends right. Turns out it was that the "friendship"
was as fleeting as the oppourtunityiy. (I feel stranded)

You know I kinda did drown once, in the pool in the middle of people. Funny, no one paid attention. 
Those were also my friends, seriously, I had been with them for throuout the summer. We laughed, had
fun, we studied together. At the end day though I felt forgoten. I still don't know what was more
suffocating.

(Freeking god you are overextaurating? Right. No not really. Like I said I'll keep this honest. That's
not "as honest as possible | the life of a depressed imaginary boy" It's my story) 

Let me tell you something, it wasn't always like this (here we go, now we get a bit of truth right?? 
well no this was when I was 3-4) So as I was saying, I used to be a jolly kid. I once ran to a grass
field in the middle and just fell. Then I didn't get up, my mom though something bad happened. When she
came to I was laughing. 

I don't know if it was my naivety of my youger years or the over thinking mind I have now. Something, 
changed I saw more of the world, I saw people drifitng, I saw the worst of humanity. I saw how people
walked away from people in streets, while my (here I cry again) heart ached. (seriously I need to stop
my family might notice). 

I was telling about my friends right, yeah. Let me continue, you see it would be nice if it ended there.
I helped they ignored, and we went our ways. But, I don't due to me being overly forgiving or of my 
fear of being more alone in the world. I hang on to them. They use me, I help uncodintionally. 

I say that they don't help, not cause I want them to do something big. But i want them to help on 
the same things they asked me. I don't ask many times, I think like 10 times before I can ask them
to help me, afraid of ruining something we had.

But the response I get "...." Nothing, I cronfront they ignore. I leave it be, saying "It wasn't for
me, I was never going to get it"

Oh! I used to have someone who loved me uncodintionally, excluding my family or anything. Though it could be,
I remember uncoditional love before 11ish. Anways in 6th grade (sorry if my math doesn't make sense, 
I am just typing). So there was this girl, who used to love me, she even confessed. I couldn't reply 
back (I don't know how I feel about that, but I mostly feel regret for not answering properly). She 
didn't want me to love her back "Unconditional Love" but she wanted to know my honest feeling. I feel
that I seriously missed something very important that day. My karma for lying to her, so I could 
avoid confrnting my own feelings for a girl I liked & to stay in the past & cause she was very tall, 
seriouly! (If you ever read this and know who is writing - I feel that anyone who you love would be 
truly lucky)

(OMG I wrote a lot, I don't think I feel better, lets see the letters effect)

So wait what are my next steps in life. Well, I want to do what I want to do. Paradocical. But I want
to live, travel, find people like me. Seriouly there are people like me, many artists in Deviant Art 
make stuff for others "unconditionally" one had a quora page that I went to cause her/his drawings
were just really pretty. I found that she asked for donations to feed herself everyday. She made the
things with a characted cause she loved it and wanted to do something with that. 

I really respect that. I will do the same move to my dream. Hopefully, someday I can help those like 
me. This world already has its share of rich people (many generous, many humorful) but there is another
side of it right. THe world ain't completely jolly. (Here I cry again) There was movie about this
I don't rember but it had these emotion chrater in the head of the girl, and it controleed stuff. Happy
& Sad went out of control room and in the end both collaborated. Something like that.

Now that I think about it, this could be though of as my tears or my scream to the world. My muffled 
scream at the end of the world, with no one nearby (who am I writing this to?). 

I can do another section or repo on what I believe, pretty cool stuff. Oh! Something I love about 
myself. Wait this is my scream of the world, I do love myself, I ain't self deprecitating, most of the
times. But now I won't be. Like seriously, this is reality nothing you can do about it, love yourself. 
Not necirially the world, that is why laws exist and people change things. 

Where was I, oh right things i love about myself. I have a great imagination, I still my alliases
with myself, I can come up with really cool project, I'll show you. Sometimes, they are not feasible 
but still. I would love to make it. They all carry the potential to change the world, in some small or
big way as posssible. Something small would be like my idea to make a Gmail-Add on that allows 
individuals to manage theis mail with graphs and interactions for mass selected deleting and more 
(you would think things for buisness would also come for individuals, I haven't seen one, though
I checked that 1 year ago) All ideas I make here won't be mine. 

I want to meet me, not seclude myself, if I could I would just help other people build theirs. But
that wouldn't be helful for society would it. 

oh, wait. Nooooo. If i realese it in my name. People will know who is writing. I scared, don't judge me. Things
I say here are what I feel, but. Acutally there is no argument against that, I will feel this way, or
at least have the memories of this experiences. Well, if you are reading this & aiming to hire me. Or 
in short term seeing my college apps. I can only say, thank you for your interest in me. This is 
also a part of who I am, I'll write think I believe in also, so you could take from this as yow wish.

But please if you could keep in mind: It's just that my life is much more than my past, that's why I
wrote this to help me bleed, to cry, to renew myself. There is always a downside in everyone's life.
Sometimes worse than this, like Ross Ledehrman, I feel that writing about it frees you. Not from who 
you are, but from the shackles that chain you from who you want to be. 

Well, I for people who know me or would get to know me, be yourself. I would be myself too, but I 
will change. I will change in the way that I stop being used, I start making life for myself. I 
create me, and I find people who will uncoditionally love that, or feel fine with it. I will stop 
wearing the mask people force on me, I would create my own identidy. 

I write this for myself, no matter who reads it from now. I will change & find those who I could love.

PS: Ruki is a alias it is from on of the old games on the internet, which was like a tcycoon game
I played that had these dolls. It was really cute, something like build your buisenss. 


Something to add. Now that I have declared something, I know the divided between my family and me, is
becuae of me. I did something, no one would want. I don't know why I did it. Maybe it was the 
pressure, the stress. No. I don't think so. Maybe I just suffocated, maybe I felt most of what I did 
didn't matter so I did something that paradoxically, made nothing I do matter. I feel their 
dissapointment or at least my feelings of such. No matter how much they deny it or say it is alright.
Somethimes I just wish that it would just be me who feels such a way, but me asking that would just
be selfish. + Even if I did sometimes forget, I hear it from my family and I would probaly live
remembering. 


Alright no peace out.
