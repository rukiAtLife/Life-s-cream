I seriouly wonder if anyone world acutally read this. Maybe never. I wonder if that would stop me from 
from wrting but I don't know. I'll keep wrting till I don't want to anymore. Well. . . .

I regret taking useless things & seeking approval from others the past 2 years in high school. I don't 
know. 

Well I regret it due to all my role models that are young & can maybe relate to my generation all went 
to a top 10 college in their nation. They are intellectuals & build really great thing. 
But I don't know if them going to such a great college is the cause or a correlation. Maybe people who
go to these colleges are choosen from the group as diamonds in the light. Maybe that is why they are 
able to innovate and inspire.

But it could also be the challenge these colleges present to them and the people around them who can 
provide them resources they could use to innovate and help them make things that are truly worth ]
doing.

My idols are not only people who are recogonizable for their contribution to the field or some other 
aspect. Like their entreprenuer spirit. But they are people who work really hard to do things that 
they love. Regardless of the people they can impact. You can call some of them selfish. But the 
work they do helps milllions of people. 

Of course there are many people who just started a buisness or work beacuse they were unsatisfied 
with the world. They did something to change that. They didn't come from the best of the schools.
But their impact was mitigated. As if they lacked something. I mean how could humans lack something.
There is nothing these colleges can offer that can't be aquired. You can meet amaizing people in 
their daily life. Connect with them anywhere. Self-challege yourself to learn. To create to make
things better. We live in the most connected world with ammenties and equipment available to everyone.
People don't buy products from other people because of their universities. Same for people who are
collaborating with others. Then why do I regret stuff. Bro. Me screaming is changing me?

You know this might be the best thing I have done since two years. 

Lets break it down in those two years my regrets have been:
+ Not taking my idea to success, I had/have so many things I want to do. To build. They remain as 
memories or notes. --> If I could I would run away from society. Seriously. This is escapism.

I feel that since I gained "consiousness" I have been in a race. Not all of the time. But since high 
school. 

Before high school. I played soccer as a sport. I stayed outside & came home very late. I loved. I
created so many friends. Bro it was amazing. I coded, seriously, I made games. I went to coding 
classes. I talked to people about those games and grew. 

In middle school I used to read like crazy. Stories & fantasy were my main things. But they were not 
everything, I read pages of the encylopedia. There were these small "curiosity" books. Like they had
these bizzare topics. And I would learn them just for fun. 

9th grade I guess everything changed. I got into school. It took up a lot of my time. Because I 
stressed. I stressed for A - A+. But it wasn't the time it go the worst. I actually read like crazy, I 
searched the depths of the internet. Man. I found these weird website (Never encountered a virus).
And they would cover things like faith, god, the absense of god, computer systems, the brain, the 
world. Some would talk about racism its prevelance in the country. Some were for car enthusiaists. 
Many were good they shared what they learned. Life lessons & their hobbies. Some were not. One was 
where people were talkking about how like. I don't remember exactly. But this site was talking bad 
(bringing slavery back bad) about black people & people of diffrent ethnicities and racial background. 
That supprised me. I think the site should be done down. WHo knowns. 

But it was crazy some of my screams are about what I learned during that time. I read the 42 Laws of
power, How to win friends and Influence people, and a random walk down walstreet. I also read a bunch
of coding books. But mostly read research papers on that stuff as well as learning data structures and 
algorithms. But these were really fun things.

Then Covid Hit. That summer I started private tutoring. (You can check why in another scream) But
the main thing I did was read. I read a ton in high school. A lot. A lot. Manga, anime. The amount
I have read would be what some average person reads in their lifetime. I read every single day. 
Whenever I had time. It took about all my life. 

That's me regret. I read but couldn't do anything with it. I learned a lot, it lessons have taught me 
how to live. I know what makes a good story, truthfully I beacame a better human beacuse of it. I 
learned about the human condition, I learned about people, and our purpose in life.

I thought about the world, about people, their suffering. 

My regret is not forming something with it. Now I sit waiting approval from others. Trapped in the 
prision I created. Knowledgble about the world. But a prisioner to others. I don't know what I could
change. I have 4 months. Then college, then I trail down on a determined path. I probably can't 
make it to a "top 10 national" univerity. So I would be stuck? Having to go to a regular job.
Walking a lone path. Not having peopel to share my asspirations with. 

There was this one person who told me that what his dream was to live, have a job, retire at 65, and die quietlt in this world.

That would be my nightmare. I would rather die at 30. Life life freely. Explore all the world. Have
a loving family. Meet the smartest and best people in the world. Change the world in various things.
Then be gradually forgotten, but the impact I made carried.

Then to die quietly.

The books have taught me. They inspire me. Life is but a play in chaos. There is no beginning or end.
There are only trials and characters. In this play I would rather become the direcotor. Then the 
assistant.
