Something I have been wanting to do is write a book. Here is some details I wanted to write down 
about the world the character is in. 

I like realistic fiction a lot. Especially with characters who are analytical and use their brain a lot.
I grew up reading Sherlock Holmes & Tenali Ranman so I guess that really explanins I lot.
