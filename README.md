# Life-s-cream
My first Scream to the world. As honest as I can, to reduce the weight that drags me down. 


___________________________________________________________________________________________________
() - My convo thoughts with you

Fork the reprository to add your scream, (who am I talking to?)
- I am seriously conflicted I hope no one see's this but at the same time I want someone to.'

Anyways, forgive my spelling mistakes, if you could. I'll try to make it as readable as possible, but I am probably goona cry as I write so. . . .

(Am I supposed to use a Git Reprosiotry like this? Who knows but me writing here goes with the idea of helping me start making code)

Oh! Yeah code I would be building many cool stuff. My pleasure in the world. God has definetely blessed me, but at the same time my life is misreable (too sad right? Well I am curretly good at hiding everywehere I go, and this is the internet. . . Where was I going with this) I don't know.

Anyways, this is the internet and hopefull "stuff you can never delete" will help make my real life really more better. I also won't go back (unless i mess something up) so these are my un-edited way of writing? 

Sincerely,
A Ruki @ Life.
